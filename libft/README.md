# Libft 

Recode functions from the standard C library, and some other very useful functions that I will  be able to use all along this program, and future ones too, since as standard at WeThinkCode_ / 42. C Standard Library functions are forbidden.
This Project challenges you to learn, and understand the inner workings of standard C library functions, in order to use them effectively in the future.

## Getting Started

To use this library for learning or use clone it locally.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
gcc or clang compiler
```

### Installing

Installing just requires a clone or download


```
git clone https://github.com/afullstopdot/Libft.git on terminal or download the zip straigh from here.
```

## Compiling the library

For use

### Break down into end to end tests

Compile the library for use, using the Makefile

```
Make all
```

Remove the object files

```
Make clean
```

Remove the libft library

```
Make fclean
```

Remove the library and recompile

```
Make re
```

Additionally, for checking WeThinkCode_ / 42 norm

```
Make norm1 && Make norm2
```

### 

Link the library to your project

```
gcc -o executable main.c libft.a or gcc -o executable main.c -L. -lft
```

## Disclaimer

This message pertains to the students of 42 and WTC (WeThinkCode_).

This project (the first of many) is important for your development in the C language.
It is of the utmost importance that you take this serious and and implement these functions by yourself and not by copying this work.
Copying this work as is, without understanding and being able to implement your own work defeats the pedagogy and subsequently is cheating.

Goodluck!
